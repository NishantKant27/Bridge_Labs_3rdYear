📘 Learning Journal

This repository documents my daily learning journey in Java Programming and related concepts.
I’m consistently tracking the topics I study, key takeaways, and small projects or exercises I build along the way. 🚀

The goal of this journal is to maintain a structured record of my progress, strengthen my understanding of Java fundamentals, and build a strong foundation for advanced topics.

🗓️ Day 1 – Git Programming

📖 Content Covered:

Difference between Git (Version Control System) and GitHub (Cloud Hosting Platform)

Core Git concepts: Repository, Branch, Merge

Commit lifecycle: Commit → Push → Pull

Version history & commit messages

✅ Key Takeaway:
Gained a solid understanding of version control essentials, including how Git helps track changes, collaborate, and manage code efficiently.

🗓️ Day 2 – Java Architecture

📖 Content Covered:

JVM (Java Virtual Machine): role in execution of bytecode

Compiler & Interpreter working together in Java

Garbage Collector: automatic memory management

✅ Key Takeaway:
Explored the internal architecture of Java, learned about JVM, its components, and how Java achieves platform independence.

🗓️ Day 3 – Basic Elements of Programming

📖 Content Covered:

Variables & Literals

Primitive Data Types in Java

Basic Input/Output (I/O) handling

Operators (Arithmetic, Logical, Relational, etc.)

Usage of var keyword

Variable Scope and lifetime

✅ Key Takeaway:
Built a strong foundation in Java basics, understanding how variables, data types, and operators form the backbone of programming.

🗓️ Day 4 – Programming Constructs

📖 Content Covered:

Core constructs: Sequence, Selection, Iteration

For-each Loop usage

Transfer Statements (break, continue, return)

✅ Key Takeaway:
Learned different types of control flow in Java. Practiced problems using loops and conditionals.
👉 Implemented a Basic Calculator Program as a mini project.

🗓️ Day 5 – Arrays

📖 Content Covered:

1D, 2D & Multidimensional Arrays

Utility methods from java.util.Arrays

Copying arrays using System.arraycopy()

✅ Key Takeaway:
Explored array structures in Java and learned how to manipulate them effectively using built-in methods.

🗓️ Day 6 – Strings and Methods

📖 Content (Strings):

String, StringTokenizer, StringBuilder, StringBuffer

Common String methods: length(), charAt(), substring(), etc.

Passing Strings as method parameters

Handling ASCII character codes

📖 Content (Methods):

User-defined methods (parameters, return types)

Static methods & standard library methods

Math class (Math.random(), Math.pow(), etc.)

✅ Key Takeaway:
Studied string handling in Java — from immutable String to mutable StringBuilder and StringBuffer.
Also learned how to define, reuse, and organize methods efficiently. Explored built-in Math functions for problem solving.

🗓️ Day 7 – Methods (Deep Dive)

📖 Content Covered:

Method Definition & Structure: return types, parameters, access modifiers

Method Overloading – defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists

Pass by Value in Java

Recursion – solving problems by calling methods within themselves

Method Design Principles for reusability and modularity

✅ Key Takeaway:
Strengthened my knowledge of methods by learning overloading, recursion, and best practices in method design.
Practiced problems such as factorial, Fibonacci series, and prime number checks using recursive methods.

🗓️ Day 8 – Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

📖 Content Covered:

Class & Objects – blueprint vs real-world instances

Constructors – default & parameterized

this keyword usage in Java

Encapsulation – data hiding with getters & setters

Inheritance – reusing and extending functionality

Polymorphism – method overriding and dynamic dispatch

Abstraction – abstract classes and interfaces

✅ Key Takeaway:
Understood the core principles of OOP that make Java powerful, scalable, and modular.
Implemented small programs to demonstrate encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in action.
